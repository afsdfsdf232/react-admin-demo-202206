# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## 项目搭建
 npx create-react-app project-name

## 安装sass, 不需要手动配置，react脚手架已经内置了SASS配置， 只需要安装一下
 npm install sass -D
 
## 安装路由，由于现在V6版本是正式版本，则默认安装就是V6版本
  npm install react-router-dom

## 安装配置 antd
  npm install antd
  
## 配置 Webpack
  不建议使用 npm run eject 命令，是不可逆的方式
  建议使用第三方库，比如 @craco/craco (推荐方式)
  
## npm install @craco/craco -D
  问题，需要执行 npm install react-scripts@4.0.0 将react-scripts版本降级为4.x版本，否则报错；
  创建 craco.config.js 文件
  重新配置启动命令 start build test
